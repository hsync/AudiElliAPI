# Control the Audi Wallbox without the Audi API

You can use this script to start charging. 
I use this in combination with the Audi Connect Homeassistant addon, to start charging if the car is at home and the connector is plugged in.

If I find time I would like to integrate it as an addon to Homeassistant
